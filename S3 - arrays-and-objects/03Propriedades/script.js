//every element in a array or object is your property ! you can make many stuffs using them :D


let arr = [1,5,8,10,20,30,] //many elements .. 1,5,8,10...

console.log(arr.length)
console.log(arr[3])
console.log(arr['length']) // oh yes .. length is a biding property, it means its a method inside array, you can call them to return number of elements
                           // okay now you try it !
