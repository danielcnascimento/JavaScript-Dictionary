//how ou can make an array fo string, become an array itself ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

let text = 'A new career awaits as a dev web!' // motivating .. hahahaha

let arr = text.split(' '); // Use this method "split" to identify your interpolation mark, to breack them into elements in an array

console.log(arr); // look '-'


for( let i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++){
    console.log(arr[i]) // processing ... just to see them aligned on console for you bro/sisðŸ˜‰ 
}
