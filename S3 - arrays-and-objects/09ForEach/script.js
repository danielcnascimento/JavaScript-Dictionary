// Guys !! this will be very important to understand, we will use it for RUN an ARRAY ğŸ˜®
// and its not only runm its run ONE by ONE.. so the name "forEach" ğŸ’¡

let arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

arr.forEach(i => {
console.log(`the number time is: ${i}`) //practice your template strings skill !!!ğŸ˜¤
})
